# Tokenomics

## $EQUAL

The tokens basic liquid form is the $EQUAL token. This token will be used as a liquid transferable token used for emissions and have the ability to be locked into a veNFT.

## veEQUAL

$EQUAL can be locked in the form of veEQUAL into an NFT which adopts the vote escrow model for obtaining fees and directing emissions. Various lock periods can be selected and is a transferable asset.

## No Rebase

Some of you might be familiar with the rebase model that incentivizes early adopters of the SOLIDLY platform. We have decided to completely remove this model as it presents a problem for new entrants, as they find it hard to obtain a fair ownership percentage of fees and voting power later in the evolution of the exchange.

## veLOCK Period

Our lock period will be a maximum 26 weeks and the percentage of your lock time will be issued to your $veEQUAL. This modifier will give you your voting power and percentage of fees in the pool you select.

## Token Distribution

## Initial Token Mint

The initial token supply will be dispersed as per the chart above.

* The initial token supply will be limited to 1,000,000 tokens.
* Airdrop and treasury distribution will be in the form of locked $veEQUAL for the maximum 26 weeks..
* The idea is to have a fair mix for future development and reward the existing veEQUAL holders on FTM. Allowing for team focus, marketing and longevity of the platform on the new deployment on BASE.

## Airdrop Breakdown

The airdrop will be issued in the following way:

* Any wallet address that holds veEQUAL will be listed
* The allocation will be based on the current veEQUAL influence % you have

This is a limited offer of 30 days and 400,000 veEQUAL

We have chosen this method to reward people who had continual involvement in our deployment on FTM. The larger your position and duration of lock, the more you are rewarded in our airdrop.

*For fairness and to stop gaming of the system. We have taken a snapshot on the 1st August 2023 and at this point in time will determine your allocation.

## Weekly Emissions

Each weekly emissions will occur from the start of each EPOCH. The emissions will not have a ramp down period to eliminate dilution and token price depreciation. Emissions will be kept at a slow but steady decline to ensure the equalization of the platform for liquidity incentives and fees for the $veEQUAL holders.

Emissions will have a 2% decline rate per week

Week 1 - 40,000

Week 2 - 39,200

Week 3 - 38,416

Week 4 - 37,647

Week 5 - 36,156

From week 52 The decline rate will reset to 0.1%

This will provide a slow & predictable decline in emissions that will last for the next 10 years.
Remember that no rebase means less complication but a fair opportunity for people to obtain a nice share of the fees dependent on the amount of $veEQUAL, they own at any point of the emission cycle.

Also an additional 3% of EQUAL will flow to Treasury Wallet each EPOCH.
