# Launch Details

## What To Expect

This expansion is a strategic move that aims to generate new revenue opportunities for Equalizer. Here’s what our loyal participants can expect:

 *  As a supporter of EQUAL, you will continue to enjoy the system on FTM. We also recognize the value you bring to our platform, and we intend to ensure that your support is well compensated with our dedication to continuing to support the current chain.

*  Our newly minted supply totalling 10,000,000 SCALE in the below proportions, with 50% of the newly minted veSCALE to be given to existing holders.

*  Additionally you will receive veSCALE on Base. veEqual holders will receive a proportionate veSCALE position airdropped on base. This new position will be directly proportional to your current veEqual votes on FTM. This means the higher votes you have on Fantom, the higher your veSCALE position will be on the new chain.   A small portion of the Airdrop will also be distributed to other crucial supporters of Equalizer Ecosystem, such as the Direct Liquidity Providers, Tarot’s Leveraged farmers, external auto-compounder users and more! 


##  Airdrop Criteria 


The airdrop involved the distribution of SCALE tokens to users who held or engaged with the Equalizer protocol on Fantom. This distribution was carried out in celebration of the launch of Equalizer on Base Chain and as an expression of appreciation to the community for their steadfast support.





### Eligibility

To be eligible for the airdrop, users had to meet the following criteria:

* Hold veEqual NFT.
* Provide liquidity to the WFTM/EQUAL pool on Equalizer.
* Provide liquidity to the WFTM/EQUAL pool on Tarot.
* Lend Equal tokens on Tarot.
* Hold liquid Equal tokens in their wallets.

### Points

Each user was awarded points based on their holdings and activities. The following table shows the point breakdown:


|Activity| Points |
|--|--|
| veEqual holders | 100 points per veEqual token |
| Liquidity Providers on Equalizer | 50 points per Equal token in LP |
| Liquidity Providers on Tarot | 40 points per Equal token in LP |
| Tarot Lenders | 5 points per Equal token |
| Liquid Equal holder | 2 points per Equal token |


To be eligible for the airdrop, users had to have a minimum of 1337 points.

#### Example

Consider a user with the following holdings and activities:

1000 veEqual tokens
400 Equal tokens in LP on Equalizer and 2000 FTM
1000 liquid Equal tokens in their wallet

This user's total points would be calculated as follows:

1000 veEQUAL x 100 points + 400 Equal in LP on Equalizer x 50 points + 1000 liquid Equal x 2 points = 122,000 points

### Distribution 
 

The airdrop was conducted without prior announcement and a future-dated snapshot to prevent naughty traders from pumping and dumping EQUAL. This would have trapped newcomers who might have purchased and locked new EQUAL at higher rates because of these traders front-running them.  

The airdrop snapshot was taken on UTC: Fri, 08 Sep 2023 15:25:03 GMT,  Fantom Block Height: 67,980,758
