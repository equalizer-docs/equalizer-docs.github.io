# Migration to Sonic Chain

Fantom Foundation has decided to start a new chain called Sonic with an upgraded Fantom Virtual Machine, and will continue the old Fantom Opera chain in maintenance deprecated capacity only going ahead.

In response, Equalizer has decided to Hard Fork the current Fantom Opera Equalizer into 2 splits:
- Equalizer on Fantom
- Equalizer on Sonic

User have the option of choosing to have their assets migrated to the Sonic chain version by taking part in the Nigration process during the migration window in December 2024.

The migration portal can be accessed at the below link:
# [migration.equalizer.exchange](https://migration.equalizer.exchange)

Equalizer on both chains, after migration will be independent of each other, and the EQUAL token on both chains will govern only the chain it is on. Both tokens will chart their own price actions and have their own demand-supply dymanics.

As a result of migration, EQUAL supply will be split into two parts,
- one that remains on old Fantom Opera chain
- other that moves to govern Equalizer on the new Sonic chain

The emissions (9975 EQUAL per week at the time of writing) will be split as well directly proportional to the amount of veEQUAL that stays vs that which migrates to sonic.

## Contracts
Upon migration, your tokens will be moved to Equalizer Multisig, then burned on Fantom, and made available to you through an Airdrop on Sonic.

You will also receive **Sonic Tickets** as a receipt for your assets, which are ERC20 tokens, but non-transferable. These are meant to serve as a Souvenir cherishing your Equalizer Adventures on Fantom Opera!
