# Launch your Token on Equalizer!

Equalizer is **Community Powered** Decentralized Protocol. We strive to offer to the best tokens to our traders as well as provide earning opportunities to Liquidity Providers. We understand that the real success in DeFi comes serving the community with useful features that make their lives better!

A big part of this community are the exciting projects that launch their token on Chain. We welcome all projects to list their Tokens on Equalizer and promise our full marketing support and technical assistance!

## Getting Listed
As we offer a Decentralized Protocol, anyone can list their Tokens permissionlessly on Equalizer on their own!

### Creating a new pool
Simply go to the [Create Liquidity Pool](https://equalizer.exchange/liqiudity/create) page to create a Liquidity pool for your token to enable trading for that pair!

### Special tokens
We support all sorts of tokens, be it simple ERC20 or exotic assets with transer-taxes, Rebases, auto-LPs, Reflection, etc.

> - Exotic tokens must make the `pairFees` address of your pool exempt of any taxes or rebases, or else you might not be able to claim the trade-fee rewards!
> - You can find it on the liquidity pool's ftmscan page on the 'Read Contract' tab under the **`fees`** heading.
> - Exempting the `pairFees` address will not impact the transfer taxes taking place during trades or any other interactions with the liquidity pool and your rebases or taxes will still work as expected. This step only removes the taxes/rebases from the trade-fee portion, not the actual trade volume!
> - Equalizer's Gauges & Bribes are the First DEX to natively support Exotic tokens, and require no special exemptions.

Please contact us if you have any more questions!
