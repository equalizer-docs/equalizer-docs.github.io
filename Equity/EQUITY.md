# EQUITY

EQUITY is a decentralized venue for spot and perpetual trading, characterized by reduced swap costs and zero trading impact on prices. The trading environment is bolstered by an innovative multi-asset pool, which rewards liquidity contributors with fees derived from market-making, swaps, and leverage trading activities.

Prices are dynamically adjusted using both in-house algorithms and a composite of rates from premier high-volume exchanges.

Equity is an integration to the Equalizer.Exchange system integrating the two together for the benefit of veEQUAL holders
