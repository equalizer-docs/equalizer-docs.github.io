# What is Equity?
> The new frontier of decentralized derivatives trading on Fantom.

Equity is more than just an exchange â€• it is a hub where Spot & Derivative markets thrive without boundaries. Our cutting-edge platform brings together minimal swap fees and zero price impact trading, offering you a seamless and cost-effective trading experience.

Supported by our groundbreaking multi-asset pool, we share the success of Equity with our governors:
> The **veEQUAL holders**.

## How?

Equity rewards our veEQUAL NFT holders with the fees stemming from Four Sources:
- Market-making (Liquidity Provisioning)
- Spot Trading (Simple Exchange)
- Flash Loans (Instant repayments)
- Derivatives Trading (Perpetual Swaps)

Experience fluidity like never before with our dynamic pricing mechanism. This advanced feature, backed by sophisticated in-house algorithms and an amalgamation of rates from leading high-volume exchanges, ensures accurate real-time price information which drives extremely Capital-Efficient liquidity utilization.

## Benefits That Go Beyond Expectations

### For Our Valued Token Holders
> Unleash the power of your veEQUAL NFTs!

With our innovative system, you stand to reap higher fees, further enhancing your earning potential on top of the Equalizer V2 Fees & Bribes. As we evolve, so do the benefits for our esteemed token holders. Embrace the EQUITY revolution and let your voting NFTs pay you cash each and every week!

### For Our Dedicated Liquidity Providers
In providing liquidity, you will in turn receive a dynamic mix of veEQUAL and EQUAL. EQUITY LP tokens can be staked into our Equalizer V2 Gauges similar to how you would stake a LP token on Equalizer V2.

The Rewards APR for EQUITY stakers is way higher than a simple payout of Fees APR as it taps into Equalizer's Core Flywheel to enhance the emissions by using the Fees generated for Bribing the Protocol's governance!

### For Our Skilled Traders
We empower leveraged traders with sophisticated tools, transparent trading environments, and ultra-low latency execution. Here, you can magnify your trading potential while keeping risks at bay, navigating the financial seas with confidence and precision. Equity complements our Equalizer v1 & v2's Constant Product (CPAMM) markets with its new class of Weightage Driven (WAMM) pools to enable a new Derivatives market.
