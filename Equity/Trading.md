# Embrace the Future of Trading with EQUITY!

Welcome to the exciting world of EQUITY, the state-of-the-art decentralized exchange that liberates you from the constraints of traditional trading. Forget usernames and passwords and dive right into the game! Our innovative aggregate price feed curbs the risk of liquidations from fleeting wicks, offering you a robust and reliable trading platform.

## Getting Started 

Are you new to the crypto universe? Fret not! We've got your back. If you're yet to get a wallet, we recommend using **Rabby** [Download Rabby](https://rabby.io/). 

## Connecting Your Wallet 

Once your wallet is ready, it's time to connect it with our trading platform. It's as easy as clicking the "Connect Wallet" button on the EQUITY Trade page. Should you encounter a message prompting you to "Add Fantom", go ahead and add the respective network to your wallet. Alternatively, you can manually add these networks for a more personalized experience. 

## Ensuring Uninterrupted Trading 

Being a decentralized exchange, EQUITY runs data queries and transactions through an RPC URL. Now, there might be times when the RPC URL lags, resulting in slow data load. During these periods, you can use a backup URL to ensure uninterrupted trading. Just switch the RPC URL in the network settings of your wallet, and you're good to go! 

## Your First Steps in Trading 

To commence trading, you'll need to have FTM in your account. You can purchase FTM directly on Fantom using [Equalizer](https://equalizer.exchange/swap). Alternatively, you can transfer FTM to Fantom from other networks. Once the transfer is done, you're all set to embark on your trading journey. 

## Harness the Power of Swaps 

EQUITY proudly supports both swaps and leverage trading. For swaps, navigate to the "Swap" tab on our platform. Here, you can swap tokens effortlessly with zero price impact. To amplify your trading potential with leverage trading, follow the guidelines in the sections below. 

## Opening a Position 

To open a leverage position, you can select either "Long" or "Short." If you're betting on the token's price going up, opt for a long position. If you foresee the token's price going down, a short position is your go-to. After selecting your side, enter the amount you wish to pay and the leverage you intend to use. 

## Position Management 

After initiating a trade, you can view it under your Positions list. Feel free to edit it as per your needs by depositing or withdrawing collateral. This allows you to efficiently manage your leverage and liquidation price. 

## Closing a Position 

Closing a position, be it partially or completely, is a breeze. Just hit the "Close" button and it's done! 

## Stop-Loss / Take-Profit Orders 

Want to hedge your risks and maximize your profits? Use our stop-loss and take-profit orders. Once a trigger order is set, it appears under the "Orders" tab. You can modify it anytime according to market conditions. 

## Partial Liquidations 

With EQUITY, you always have control over your positions. If the token's price crosses a certain point, your position will be automatically closed, ensuring you never lose more than you're willing to. 

## Pricing & Fees 

EQUITY offers competitive pricing with no price impacts for trades. Thus, you can execute large trades exactly at the mark price. Our fee structure is straightforward and transparent - just 0.1% of the position size to open/close a position.
